## üí≠ Motivation

- **Bridging East and West**: To create an AI system that can effectively integrate Traditional Chinese Medicine wisdom with modern Western medical knowledge, providing comprehensive healthcare solutions.
- **Professional Medical AI**: To develop a specialized medical AI that understands the nuances of both medical systems and can provide contextually appropriate recommendations.
- **Accessible Healthcare**: To democratize access to integrated medical knowledge, making both TCM and Western medicine expertise available to broader populations.
- **Research Advancement**: To provide open-source tools and datasets for advancing research in medical AI and integrated healthcare systems.

## üìö Data

### Overview

To leverage the best of both Traditional Chinese Medicine and Western Medicine knowledge, we fine-tune **ShuZhi QiHuang** using five comprehensive types of medical data:

| Type | Scale | Descriptions | Examples |
|------|-------|-------------|----------|
| **TCM Q&A Data** | 85,000+ | Traditional Chinese Medicine question-answer pairs covering diagnostics, treatments, and herbal medicine | üí¨: What are the effects and functions of ginseng?<br>üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è: Ginseng has the following main effects:<br>1. **Tonifying vital energy**: Used for qi deficiency and collapse<br>2. **Restoring pulse and preventing collapse**: For heart failure and shock<br>3. **Nourishing spleen and lungs**: Treating spleen-lung qi deficiency<br>4. **Generating fluids and quenching thirst**: For fluid damage and diabetes<br>5. **Calming spirit and enhancing intelligence**: Improving insomnia and forgetfulness... |
| **Western Medicine Instructions** | 92,000+ | Modern medical instruction data including disease diagnosis, treatment protocols, and pharmaceutical guidance | üí¨: Please analyze the possible causes of the following symptoms<br>üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è: Based on the symptoms of headache, fever, chills, no sweating, and floating-tight pulse, the patient may have wind-cold exterior syndrome:<br>1. Headache and chills indicate external pathogen invasion<br>2. Fever without sweating suggests wind-cold binding the exterior<br>3. Floating-tight pulse is typical of wind-cold exterior pattern<br>Recommend using Mahuang Decoction or Jingfang Baidu Powder for treatment... |
| **Integrated Medical Conversations** | 76,500+ | Multi-turn conversations integrating both TCM and Western medicine perspectives for comprehensive patient care | üí¨: I have been experiencing chronic fatigue and digestive issues. Can you provide both TCM and Western medicine perspectives?<br>üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è: From a **Western medicine** perspective, chronic fatigue with digestive issues could indicate conditions like IBS, chronic fatigue syndrome, or autoimmune disorders. Recommended tests include complete blood count, thyroid function, and inflammatory markers.<br><br>From a **TCM** perspective, this suggests spleen qi deficiency with possible dampness accumulation. The spleen governs transformation and transportation of nutrients. Treatment would focus on strengthening spleen qi using formulas like Sijunzi Tang...<br>üí¨: How can both approaches be integrated?<br>üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è: An integrated approach would combine Western diagnostic testing to rule out serious conditions while using TCM therapies to address the underlying constitutional imbalance. This might include dietary therapy, herbal medicine, and acupuncture alongside appropriate Western treatments... |
| **Medical Literature Corpus** | 150,000+ | Comprehensive medical texts from both traditional Chinese medical classics and modern medical literature | Classical texts from Huangdi Neijing, Shanghan Lun, modern medical textbooks, clinical guidelines, and research papers covering integrated medical approaches |
| **Clinical Case Studies** | 45,000+ | Real-world clinical cases demonstrating integrated TCM-Western medicine treatment approaches | Anonymized clinical cases showing successful integration of both medical systems in treating various conditions |
